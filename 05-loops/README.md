# Loops

Loop repeats a block of command until a specific condition is met.

## for Loop

Iterates over a predefined list of items (like strings, file names, or numbers) and executes the block of code for each item.

**Syntax**

```
for item in list
do
    # commands to execute
done
```

## while Loop

Executes commands as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

**Syntax**

```
while [ condition ]
do
    # commands to execute
done
```

## until loop

Executes commands as long as a specified condition is false (opposite of while; checked before each iteration).

**Syntax**

```
until [ condition ]
do
    # commands to execute
done
```
