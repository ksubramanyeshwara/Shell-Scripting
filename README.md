# 💻 Shell Scripting

This repository contains theory, examples, and reusable shell scripts to help understand the basics, practice commands, and build confidence in writing automation scripts using the shell.

## 📖 What You’ll Find

This repo is focused on:

- Learning core **shell scripting concepts**
- Writing **real-world automation scripts**
- Understanding how Linux commands and scripts work together

Everything here is created while learning and experimenting — so it’s practical, incremental, and beginner-friendly.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By using this repository, the aim is to:

- Understand what shell scripts are and how they work
- Learn to automate repetitive tasks using scripts
- Master key features: Variables, conditionals (if, case), loops (for, while, until), functions, arrays, and more.
- Handle advanced ops: File I/O, regex, processes, cron jobs, and error-proofing.
- Apply best practices: Portable code (sh vs. bash), shellcheck linting, and modular design.
- Build & deploy: Create portfolio projects like a full backup suite or CI/CD hook.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Linux/macOS (or WSL on Windows)
- Bash 5.0+ (most distros have it)
- Basic terminal familiarity (e.g., ls, cd)
- Optional: VS Code with ShellCheck extension for linting
