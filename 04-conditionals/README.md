# Conditionals

Comparing numbers is a core part of logic. You use square brackets [ ] or double brackets [[]].

- Equality: -eq (e.g., [ $a -eq $b ])
- Not Equal: -ne
- Greater Than: -gt
- Less Than: -lt
- Greater or Equal: -ge
- Less or Equal: -le

> Do not use < or > inside standard brackets for comparisons, as these are treated as file redirections.
